                <p>
                    Styles in Figma mean you don’t have to repetitively enter values for typography, colors and elevations, minimising the risk of inconsistencies and streamlining the design process.

            <div class="box">
                <h2>Use the components</h2>
                <p>
                    There’s a bunch of pre-configured components for the Style Guide page and under the components section. Buttons, steppers, filter options, and more for your tastes and requirements.
